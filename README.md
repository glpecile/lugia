# Welcome to Lugia 🐉

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created using [rnreusables](https://rnr-docs.vercel.app/getting-started/introduction/) and [@bacons/mdx](https://github.com/EvanBacon/expo-mdx).

## Get started 🚀

1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2. Start the app

    ```bash
     bun run web # or for mobile
     # bun run ios
     # bun run android
    ```

This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Add a post ✍️

When you're ready, run:

```bash
bun run add-post
```

You'll be prompted the following questions:

```plaintext
Enter blog post title:
Enter short title:
Enter subtitle:
Enter slug (or press enter for auto-generated):
Enter tags (comma-separated):
```

This will then create a new `index.mdx` post inside the **blog** directory where you can edit it in markdown format.
